# **The OCI Open LZ &ndash; [Blueprints](#)**

&nbsp; 

Welcome to the **OCI Open LZ Blueprints**, a set of complete and runnable OCI landing zones that will help you onboard and run OCI. 

There are three blueprints available, choose the most suitable according to your objectives, review the design, and run the model.

&nbsp; 

Note these blueprints can be used directly as OCI [**Standard Landing Zones**](https://github.com/oracle-devrel/technology-engineering/blob/main/landing-zones/standard_landing_zones/readme.md) or as a guide or starting point for a [**Tailored Design**](https://github.com/oracle-devrel/technology-engineering/blob/main/landing-zones/tailored_landing_zones/readme.md). You can also complement your Landing Zone with [**Addons**](/addons/readme.md) such as [Network Hub models](/addons/oci-hub-models/readme.md), or extend it with pluggable [**Workload Extensions**](/workload-extensions/readme.md) to reduce your time-to-production with OCI best practices.
