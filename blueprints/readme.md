Note these blueprints can be used directly as OCI [**Standard Landing Zones**](https://github.com/oracle-devrel/technology-engineering/blob/main/landing-zones/standard_landing_zones/readme.md) or as a guide or starting point for a [**Tailored Design**](https://github.com/oracle-devrel/technology-engineering/blob/main/landing-zones/tailored_landing_zones/readme.md). You can also complement your Landing Zone with [**Addons**](/addons/readme.md) such as [Network Hub models](/addons/oci-hub-models/readme.md), or extend it with pluggable [**Workload Extensions**](/workload-extensions/readme.md) to reduce your time-to-production with OCI best practices.
