## **2. EBS Cloud Manager Deployment**

To deploy EBS Cloud Manager the next step is to create and configure the EBS Cloud Manager compute instance.

The detailed steps for this are documented [here](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26401_01/doc.122/f35809/T679330T679339.htm#T680521)

The following are the initial resources for deploying the EBS Cloud Manager compute instance from Marketplace:

| Resource | Name |
| --- | --- |
| Compartment | cmp-lzp-platform-ebscm |
| Virtual Cloud Network | vcn-fra-lzp-m-ebs |
| Subnet | sn-fra-lzp-m-ebs-app |

The following are some of the resources required to be selected in the Oracle E-Business Suite Cloud Manager Configure Script:

| Resource | Name |
| --- | --- |
| Group | grp-lzp-platform-ebscm-admins |
| Load Balancer Visibility Type | Private |
| Load Balancer Subnet | sn-fra-lzp-m-ebs-lb |

> [!NOTE]
> The EBS Landing Zone Extension includes both Security Lists and Network Security Groups so that either may be utilized.
