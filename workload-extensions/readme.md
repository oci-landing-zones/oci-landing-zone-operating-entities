# **The OCI Open LZ &ndash; [Workload Extensions](#)**

&nbsp; 

Welcome to the **OCI Open LZ Workload Extensions**.  

A workload extension is an **OCI solution design ready to receive specific workloads** on top of a landing zone. Each of these extensions follows the [tailored landing zone approach](/landing-zones/tailored_landing_zones/tailored_landing_zones.md) and has a design and runtime, ready for deployment:

- In terms of **design**, each solution will contain the security, network, and runtime views. 

- In terms of **running**, each solution will have a runtime view with **IaC configurations**, pluggable to an existing landing zone, and ready to be deployed. Please note that the workload elements (VMs, Databases, etc.) are not deployed.

&nbsp; 

Find below the list of available workload landing zones and our backlog. Be free to reach out if you require any other flavor.
