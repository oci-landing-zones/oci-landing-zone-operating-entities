# **The OCI Open LZ &ndash; [Workload Extensions](#)**

&nbsp; 

Welcome to the **OCI Open LZ Workload Extensions**.  

A workload extension is a tangible and **self-contained** set of resources with a clear functional scope, **pluggable** to a Landing Zone. They have a design and an implementation ready to receive a specific workloads on top of a landing zone. Each of these extensions follows the [tailored landing zone approach](https://github.com/oracle-devrel/technology-engineering/tree/main/landing-zones/tailored_landing_zones) and is ready for deployment:

- In terms of **design**, each solution will contain the security, network, and runtime views. 

- In terms of **running**, each solution will have a runtime view with **IaC configurations**, pluggable to an existing landing zone, and ready to be deployed. Please note that the workload elements (VMs, Databases, etc.) are not deployed.

Find below the list of available workload landing zones and our backlog. Be free to reach out if you require any other flavor.
