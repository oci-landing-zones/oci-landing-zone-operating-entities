# **The OCI Open LZ &ndash; [Workload Extensions](#)**

&nbsp; 

Welcome to the **OCI Open LZ Workload Extensions**.  

A workload extension is a tangible and **self-contained** set of resources with a clear functional scope, **pluggable** to a Landing Zone. They have a design and an implementation ready to receive a specific workloads on top of a landing zone. Each of these extensions follows the [tailored landing zone approach](https://github.com/oracle-devrel/technology-engineering/tree/main/landing-zones/tailored_landing_zones) and is ready for deployment:

- In terms of **design**, each solution will contain the security, network, and runtime views. 

- In terms of **running**, each solution will have a runtime view with **IaC configurations**, pluggable to an existing landing zone, and ready to be deployed. Please note that the workload elements (VMs, Databases, etc.) are not deployed.
