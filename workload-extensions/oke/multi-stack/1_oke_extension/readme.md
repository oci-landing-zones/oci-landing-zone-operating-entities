## **2. Setup IAM Configuration**

For configuring and running the One-OE Landing Zone OKE extension IAM Layer use the following JSON file: [oci_oke_lz_ext_iam.auto.tfvars.json](./oci_oke_lz_ext_iam.auto.tfvars.json). You can customize this configuration to fit your exact OCI IAM topology.

This configuration file covers three categories of resources described in the next sections.

###  **2.1. Compartments**

The OKE LZ extension provisions three **compartments**: two dedicated to managing environments, such as PROD and PRE-PROD, and a third compartment for management purposes.

New OKE compartments will be added as platform in each One-OE LZ environment, following the example shown in the next diagram:

<img src="../content/One-OE-LZP.png" width="1000" height="value">

> [!NOTE]
> For extended documentation regarding compartment definition please refer to the [Identity & Access Management CIS Terraform module compartment example](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/terraform-oci-cis-landing-zone-iam/blob/main/compartments/examples/vision/input.auto.tfvars.template).


### **2.2 Groups**

The OKE extension will deploy IAM groups to manage resources in OKE compartments and provide fine-grained access to specific OKE resources.

As part of the deployment the following groups are created in the [Default Identity Domain](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/domains/overview.htm):


| ID     |     NAME                       | TYPE | OBJECTIVES                                  |
| ------ |  -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |---|
| GRP.00 |  grp-lzp-m-platform-oke-admins | IAM |Group for managing mgt OKE-related resources |
| GRP.01 | grp-lzp-p-platform-oke-admins | IAM| Group for managing Prod OKE-related resources |
| GRP.02 |  grp-lznp-pp-platform-oke-admins | IAM | Group for managing Pre-prod OKE-related resources |
| GRP.03 |  grp-lzp-p-platform-oke-viewer-role | IAM + OKE RBAC |Group for managing Prod OKE-related resources |
| GRP.04 |  grp-lzp-p-platform-oke-admin-role | IAM + OKE RBAC |Group for managing Prod OKE-related resources |
| GRP.05 |  grp-lzp-pp-platform-oke-viewer-role | IAM + OKE RBAC |Group for managing Pre-prod OKE-related resources |
| GRP.06 |  grp-lzp-pp-platform-oke-admin-role | IAM + OKE RBAC |Group for managing Pre-prod OKE-related resources |



In our pattern we define two different types of groups:

1. **IAM groups** to manage resources in OKE compartments.
2. **IAM groups with OKE RBAC** to grant fine-grained access control to OKE specific resources. In addition to IAM, the Kubernetes RBAC Authorizer can enforce additional fine-grained access controls via Kubernetes RBAC roles and clusterroles. A Kubernetes RBAC role is a collection of permissions. For example, a role might include read permission on pods and list permission for pods. A Kubernetes RBAC clusterrole is just like a role, applies across the whole cluster. A Kubernetes RBAC rolebinding maps a role to a user or group, granting that role's permissions to the user or group for resources in a namespace. Similarly, a Kubernetes RBAC clusterrolebinding maps a clusterrole to a user or group, granting that clusterrole's permissions across the entire cluster. IAM and the Kubernetes RBAC Authorizer work together to enable users who have been successfully authorized by at least one of them to complete the requested Kubernetes operation.

In our case as an example we have created the recommended groups for the prod oke cluster and pre-prod oke cluster. These are the steps for prod :

1. Create a new group in OCI IAM (e.g grp-lzp-p-platform-oke-viewer-role, which is already included in the blueprint)
2. Configure an OCI policy to grant access to the group to access the OKE clusters. (e.g pcy-p-platform-oke-rbal-viewer-role, which is already included in the blueprint) 
3. Create Roles and Role Bindings in OKE RBAC to authorize our user to access OKE resources. In a text editor, create the following manifest (for example, called pod-reader-group.yaml) to define the role and a role binding to enable the new IAM group to list pods in the kube-system namespace:

```
cat > pod-reader-group.yaml << EOF
  kind: Role
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: pod-reader-ks
  namespace: kube-system
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
---
kind: RoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: pod-reader-ks-role-binding
  namespace: kube-system
subjects:
- kind: group
  name: <group-ocid>
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: pod-reader-ks
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io

EOF
```
4. Create the new role and rolebinding by applying configuration file to the Kubernetes. 
  ```kubectl apply -f pod-reader-group.yml```

### **3.4 Dynamic groups**

The OKE LZ Extension includes the following dynamic group as an example:

* **dg-lzp-p-platform-oke** for authenticating all instances of the Prod OKE cluster against OCI.
* **dg-lzp-pp-platform-oke** for authenticating all instances of the Pre-prod OKE cluster against OCI.

See [OCI documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/callingservicesfrominstances.htm) for reference.

> [!NOTE]
> For extended documentation regarding dynamic groups please refer to the [Identity & Access Management CIS Terraform module dynamic groups example](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/terraform-oci-cis-landing-zone-iam/blob/main/dynamic-groups/examples/vision/input.auto.tfvars.template).


### **2.3 Policies**

As part of the deployment the following policies are created:
| Policy                     | Description                                             | Manage resources             | Use resources                   | Inspect resources |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| pcy-p-platform-oke-admins | Grants group **grp-lzp-p-platform-oke-admins** permissions. | OKE, Computes, VCN | NSG, Subnets, VNICs, IPs | compartments    |
| pcy-pp-platform-oke-admins | Grants group **grp-lzp-pp-platform-oke-admins** permissions. | OKE, Computes, VCN | NSG, Subnets, VNICs, IPs | compartments    |
| pcy-m-platform-oke-admins | Grants group **grp-lzp-m-platform-oke-admins** permissions. | OKE, Computes, VCN | NSG, Subnets, VNICs, IPs | compartments    |
| pcy-p-platform-oke-rbac-admin-role | Grants group **pcy-p-platform-oke-rbac-admin-role** permissions. | -  | OKE |  -  |
| pcy-p-platform-oke-rbac-view-role | Grants group **pcy-p-platform-oke-rbac-view-role** permissions. | - | OKE |  -  |
| pcy-pp-platform-oke-rbac-admin-role | Grants group **pcy-pp-platform-oke-rbac-admin-role** permissions. | -  | OKE |  -  |
| pcy-pp-platform-oke-rbac-view-role | Grants group **pcy-pp-platform-oke-rbac-view-role** permissions. | -  | OKE |  -   |
| pcy-root-oke-hybrid | The **pcy-p-platform-oke-hybrid** policy is an example of an additional IAM policy required when a cluster and its related resources reside in separate compartments.To use the OCI VCN-Native Pod Networking CNI plugin on top a LZ deployment, where a cluster's related resources (such as node pools, VCN, and VCN resources) are in a different compartment to the cluster itself, you must include this [policy](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Concepts/contengpodnetworking_topic-OCI_CNI_plugin.htm). If you are deploying the flannel option this specific policy is not needed.| instances  | private-ips ,network-security-groups | -    |
| pcy-p-platform-oke-secrets| The **pcy-p-platform-oke-secrets** is an example of a recommended policy to allow applications running on the cluster to be authenticated with OCI through InstancePrincipal, for example to grant access to secrets. To read more about his check this [article](https://vaibhav-sonavane.medium.com/use-instance-principal-to-access-secrets-6c4aee1bfea4) or the [official documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Tasks/callingservicesfrominstances.htm?source=post_page-----6c4aee1bfea4--------------------------------)| -  | - | -    |


Additional policies may be required for using [Capacity Reservations](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Tasks/contengmakingcapacityreservations.htm) or if you choose to [manage the master encryption key yourself](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Tasks/contengencryptingdata.htm). These policies are not included in this example, make sure to add them if they apply to your use case.
For a detailed review of OKE policies, please refer to the official OKE documentation [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Concepts/contengpolicyconfig.htm#Policy_Configuration_for_Cluster_Creation_and_Deployment) and this [link](https://github.com/oracle-devrel/technology-engineering/blob/main/app-dev/devops-and-containers/oke/oke-policies/policies.md).


> [!NOTE]
>For extended documentation regarding policies refer to the [Identity & Access Management CIS Terraform module policies examples](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/terraform-oci-cis-landing-zone-iam/tree/main/policies/examples) and [policy resource documentation](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/terraform-oci-cis-landing-zone-iam/tree/main/policies)


## **3. Setup Network Configuration**

The OKE Cluster requires specific subnets. You can review all these requirements in the [OKE documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/ContEng/Concepts/contengnetworkconfig.htm).

By default we recommend to use native pod networking ([NPN](https://blogs.oracle.com/cloud-infrastructure/post/announcing-vcn-native-pod-networking-for-kubernetes-in-oci)).That provide more flexibility, more granular security, and consistent performance.

<img src="../content/ProdNetwork_NPN.png" width="1000" height="auto">

For configuring and running the OKE LZ extension NPN Network layer use the following JSON file: [oci_oke_lz_ext_network_npn.auto.tfvars.json](./oci_oke_lz_ext_network_npn.auto.tfvars.json).


If you choose to use Flannel, the diagram will be almost identical, except it will not include the pod subnet.

<img src="../content/ProdNetwork_FLANNEL.png" width="1000" height="auto">

For configuring and running the OKE LZ extension Network layer use the following JSON file: [oci_oke_lz_ext_network_flannel.auto.tfvars.json](./oci_oke_lz_ext_network_flannel.auto.tfvars.json).


Our OKE LZ extension will deploy the necessary core resources for both the Production and Pre-production environments included in the ONE-OE blueprint. This example is based on the OCI VCN-Native Pod Networking CNI scenario. You should make a few adjustments and select the appropriate files for a Flannel setup.

<img src="../content/Network.png" width="1000" height="auto">


The network layer covers the following resources:
1. Hub VCN for traffic inspection purposes, centralized DNS service, Internet Gateway, and NAT Gateway.
2. Spoke management VCN for OKE management purposes.
3. Spokes VNCs for each environment - one Spoke Pre-prod OKE VCN and one Spoke Prod OKE VCN
4. Subnets - OKE required subnets; like cp,workers,pods,lb,database,fss and bastion subnet.
5. Service Gateway - Service Gateway for access OCI services in all VCNs
6. Security List - allowing all ingress/egress
7. NSGs.
8. Route Tables.
9. DRG Attachments - Connect spokes with the central Hub

In this asset, we use reserved CIDR blocks for the different VCNs, but this can be customized. To learn more about managing your OCI subnetting, we recommend checking this [asset](/addons/oci-lz-subnetting).


For customization of the pre-defined setup please refer to the [Networking documentation](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/terraform-oci-cis-landing-zone-networking) for documentation and examples.

## **4. JSON files Required Changes**

If ONE-OE is used as the foundation Landing Zone with output saving enabled, running this OKE extension with the added dependencies will automatically match the keys with the correct OCIDs. No changes to the JSON file are needed. Therefore, you can skip this section and move to point 5.

If you are using the CIS Landing Zone or another OCI Landing Zone option, this configuration file requires modification to reference the OCIDs of the existing deployed resources. Locate the values indicated below and replace them with the correct OCIDs.

| Resource         | Section          | Replace with OCIDs              | Description                        |
| ------------------------- | ------| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| cmp-lzp-p-platform |  compartments| CMP-LZP-P-PLATFORM-KEY | The Prod platforms compartment OCID in Prod Env |
| cmp-lzp-d-platform | compartments| CMP-LZP-PP-PLATFORM-KEY| The Pre-prod platforms compartment OCID  in Preprod Env |
| cmp-lzp-platform |compartments | CMP-LZP-PLATFORM-KEY| The Shared platforms compartment OCID |
| Prod Network Compartment | Network| CMP-LZP-P-NETWORK-KEY | The OCID of the Prod Network Compartment |
| Pre-prod Network Compartment | Network| CMP-LZP-PP-NETWORK-KEY |  The OCID of the Pre-prod Network Compartment  |
| Mgt Network Compartment |  Network| CMP-LZP-NETWORK-KEY |  The OCID of the Network Compartment |
| Hub DRG                  | Network| DRG-FRA-LZP-HUB-KEY                 | The OCID of the DRG in Hub deployed by One-OE LZ             |
| Hub DRG Route Table      | Network| OCID-DRG-HUB-ROUTE-TABLE      | The OCID of Route table in DRG  |

**NOTE:**
Policies contain compartment paths. 
The paths can change based on the modification in the previous [Compartments](#21-compartments) section. The paths need to be updated following the OCI [Policies and Compartment hierarchy](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Identity/Concepts/policies.htm#hierarchy).


## **4. Deploy**

Use the magic button provided in the summary section to deploy the OKE LZ extension using [Oracle Resource Manager (ORM)](../../../../commons/content/orm.md) or use [Terraform CLI](../../../../commons/content/terraform.md).

This operation creates a default routing configuration. To complete the network layer setup, deploy the firewalls and update the routing in the hub to prepare for deploying the OKE cluster. All these steps are defined in this [POST operation](../1_oke_extension/1.1_Network_post_updates/readme.md). Once completed, everything will be ready for onboarding an OKE cluster.

**NOTE:**
**Dynamic groups matching rules** have associated OCIDs that cannot be referenced using the dependencies feature. After the first apply job, you need to update the CMP-PLATFORM-PROD-KEY and CMP-SECURITY-KEY attributes with the correct OCIDs, and then run a second apply job.

You can now proceed and create the [OKE Cluster](../2_oke/).
