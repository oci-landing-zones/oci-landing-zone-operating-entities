## **1. Introduction**
Welcome to the **OpenShift Landing Zone Extension**.

The OpenShift Landing Zone Extension is a secure cloud environment, designed with best practices to simplify the on-boarding of OpenShift workloads and enable the continuous operations of their cloud resources. This reference architecture provides an automated landing zone configuration.
&nbsp;

## **2. Design Overview**
This workload extension uses the [One-OE](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/terraform-oci-open-lz/tree/master/blueprints/one-oe) Blueprint as the reference Landing Zone and guides the deployment of OpenShift on top of it.
&nbsp;

## **3. Deployment**

These are the required steps to provision the OpenShift workload:

 1. It's required to already have deployed OCI LZ. In this guide we will build on top of the One-OE LZ with Hub model E option. Any other OCI landing zone, such as a [CIS landing zone](https://github.com/oci-landing-zones/oci-cis-landingzone-quickstart), [OCI Core Landing Zone](https://github.com/oci-landing-zones/terraform-oci-core-landingzone) or [Multi-OE](https://github.com/oci-landing-zones/oci-landing-zone-operating-entities/tree/master/blueprints/multi-oe/generic_v1/runtime), can also used as a baseline landing zone as well.
 2. Deploy the base infrastructure from the [Step 1 - OpenShift Extension](1_openshift_extension) guide.
 3. Create OpenShift cluster in [Step 2 - OpenShift cluster creation](2_openshift/).
 4. Post setup cleaning and routing [Step 3 - Openshift extension cleanup and routing] (3_openshift_cleanup_and_routing/).
