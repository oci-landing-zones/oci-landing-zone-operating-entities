# Firewalls and RT updates <!-- omit from toc -->

## **Routing**

In all of our OCI Landing Zone models, we recommend implementing a Hub-and-Spoke network architecture. This approach enables you to deploy a firewall in the hub for traffic inspection, ensuring enhanced security. To save time in the design phase with our customers, we have included four hub models. You can choose to use either our OCI native firewall or a third-party solution, such as Fortinet or Palo Alto. Explore the four models [here](https://github.com/oci-landing-zones/oci-landing-zone-operating-entities/tree/master/addons/oci-hub-models).

In this case we have selected model A that is equipped with two OCI Network Firewalls - a next-generation managed network firewall and an intrusion detection and prevention service. The first firewall is dedicated to inbound traffic, while the second is responsible for outbound and East-West traffic control and inspection.

Model A offer two options: a **Light Version** (No Cost), where a virtual machine (VM) is deployed with a load balancer, and a **Complete Version** (With Cost), which includes the deployment of a firewalls.

The next Diagram shows the routing included in the [ONE-OE Hub A Deployment (Light Version - No Cost)](https://github.com/oci-landing-zones/oci-landing-zone-operating-entities/blob/master/addons/oci-hub-models/hub_a/readme.md):

The next Diagram shows the routing included in the HPC Ext LZ:

The next steps are to add the firewall and update the corresponding routes. To accomplish this, we need to follow the steps outlined in the [Hub A Deployment (Light Version - No Cost)](https://github.com/oci-landing-zones/oci-landing-zone-operating-entities/blob/master/addons/oci-hub-models/hub_a/readme.md)

For demo purposes, we will deploy a dummy VM instead of a firewall. If needed, the steps to deploy the firewall are also provided on the previous page

**1.**

Deploy a dummy FW VM for the DMZ and INTERNAL FWs following these steps [How to create a dummy FW VM](https://github.com/oci-landing-zones/oci-landing-zone-operating-entities/blob/master/commons/content/howto_create_dummy_fw_vm.md)

<img src="../../content/Instances.png" width="1000" height="auto">

**2.**

Identify the Private IP OCID of your firewalls following these [steps](https://github.com/oci-landing-zones/oci-landing-zone-operating-entities/blob/master/commons/content/howto_identify_private_ip_ocid_vm_vnic.md)

**3.**

You can find a generic JSON file for HUB A checking our [hub models asset](https://github.com/oci-landing-zones/oci-landing-zone-operating-entities/tree/master/addons/oci-hub-models/hub_a).
For this HPC LZ EXT we provided a [customized Json file](../oci_hpc_lz_ext_open_lz_post_hub_a_network_light.auto.tfvars.json).

- Replace the "**DMZ FW PRIVATE IP OCID**" with the OCID of the Public DMZ Firewall Private IP OCID identified in the previous steps.
- Replace the "**INT FW PRIVATE IP OCID**" with the OCID of the Private Internal Firewall Private IP OCID identified in the previous steps.
- Replace the "**OCID VCN HPC PROD**" with the OCID for the Prod VCN.
- Replace the "**OCID VCN HPC PREPROD**" with the OCID for the PreProd VCN.

You can use find & replace with the IDE of your choice.

**4.**

Edit the ORM stack (STEP1) and replace the original Network JSON configuration file with the new **oci_hpc_lz_ext_open_lz_post_hub_a_network_light.auto.tfvars** file.

**5.**

Run Plan & Apply to populate the new changes.

This is the diagram that shows the Network after adding the post STEP1 configuration:

**6.**

For this HPC LZ EXT we provided a [customized Json file](../oci_hpc_lz_ext_network_post.auto.tfvars.json).

To get the Prod VCN Private View OCID:
Main menu -> Network -> DNS Management -> Private Views (Select Compartment cmp-lzp-p-network) -> Name: vcn-fra-lzp-p-hpc -> Copy OCID

To get the PreProd VCN Private View OCID:
Main menu -> Network -> DNS Management -> Private Views (Select Compartment cmp-lzp-pp-network) -> Name: vcn-fra-lzp-pp-hpc -> Copy OCID


- Replace the "**Update with DRG OCID**" with the OCID of the DRG
- Replace the "**Prod VCN Private View OCID**" with the OCID of the Prod VCN Private View
- Replace the "**PreProd VCN Private View OCID**" with the OCID of the PreProd VCN Private View
- Replace the "**Compartment cmp-lzp-p-network OCID**" with the OCID of the Prod Network Compartment
- Replace the "**Compartment cmp-lzp-pp-network OCID**" with the OCID of the PreProd Network Compartment

**7.**

Update the file **oci_hpc_lz_ext_network_post.auto.tfvars** adding the above OCID and edit the ORM stack (STEP2) replacing the original Network JSON configuration with the updated file.

Run Plan & Apply to populate the new changes.

This is the diagram that shows the final Network configuration:

Finally, this will be the complete picture after deploying the HPC Cluster Environments.
