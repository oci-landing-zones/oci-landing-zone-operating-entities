## **1. Introduction**
Welcome to the **ExaDB-C@C Landing Zone Extension**.

The ExaDB-C@C Landing Zone Extension is a secure cloud environment, designed with the best practices to simplify the on-boarding of [ExaDB-C@C workloads](https://www.oracle.com/es/engineered-systems/exadata/cloud-at-customer/) and enable the continuous operations of their cloud resources. This reference architecture provides an automated landing zone configuration.
&nbsp;

## **2. Design Overview**
This workload extension uses a simplified version of the [One-OE](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/terraform-oci-open-lz/tree/master/blueprints/one-oe) Blueprint as the reference Landing Zone and guides the deployment of ExaDB-C@C on top of it. You could use this extension also in the other Operating Entities blueprints, as the [Multi-OE](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/terraform-oci-open-lz/tree/master/blueprints/multi-oe) Blueprint or the [Multi-Tenancy](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/terraform-oci-open-lz/tree/master/blueprints/multi-tenancy) Blueprint.

A Worklod extension satisfies the requirements to deploy a specific, complex workload, providing design guidelines about where to deploy the workload in a pre-existing baseline Landing Zone.

&nbsp;

## **3. Deployment**

These are the required steps to provision the ExaDB-C@C landing zone extension:

 1. It's required to already have deployed an OCI Landing Zone. In this guide we will build on top of the [One-OE](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/terraform-oci-open-lz/tree/master/blueprints/one-oe) Landing Zone without any network.
 2. **Deploy** the Landing Zone ExaDB-C@C requirements with the [**Step 1 - ExaDB-C@C Extension**](1_exacc_extension/) guide.
 3. **Use** the **ExaDB-C@C Use Cases** to guide your deployment following [**Step 2 - ExaDB-C@C Use Cases**](2_exacc_use_cases/).
