| **TARGET RESOURCES** | - **Security**: Compartments, Groups, Policies</br>- **Network**: Spoke VCNs, Route tables, Security Lists  |
| **IAM CONFIGURATION**| [ebs_identity_cmp_grp_pl_v1.auto.tfvars.json](/examples/oci-lz-ext-ebs/op02-deploy-Open-EBS-pattern/json/ebs_identity_cmp_grp_pl_v1.auto.tfvars.json)|
| **NETWORK CONFIGURATION** |[ebs_network_rt_sl_v1.auto.tfvars.json](/examples/oci-lz-ext-ebs/op02-deploy-Open-EBS-pattern/json/ebs_network_rt_sl_v1.auto.tfvars.json) |
| **PRE-ACTIVITIES** | Execute [OP.01. Deploy OCI CIS LZ](/examples/oci-lz-ext-ebs/op01-deploy-CIS/readme.md)  |
| **POST-ACTIVITIES** | Execute [OP.03 Manual Changes](/examples/oci-lz-ext-ebs/op03-manual-changes/readme.md) |
| **RUN OPERATION** | Use [ORM](#4-run-with-orm) or use [Terraform CLI](#5-run-with-terraform-cli). |

&nbsp; 

## **2. Setup IAM Configuration**

For configuring and running the Open LZ EBS extension IAM layer use the following JSON file: [ebs_identity_cmp_grp_pl_v1.auto.tfvars.json](/examples/oci-lz-ext-ebs/op02-deploy-Open-EBS-pattern/json/ebs_identity_cmp_grp_pl_v1.auto.tfvars.json) You can customize this configuration to fit your exact OCI IAM topology.

This configuration file will cover the following three categories of resources described in the next sections.

This configuration file will require changes to reference the OCIDs of the CIS Landing Zone resources which were deployed in OP01.
Search for the values indicated below and replace with the correct OCIDs:

| Resource | OCID Text to Replace | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Root Compartment | \<OCID-COMPARTMENT-ROOT> | The root compartment OCID for the tenancy

&nbsp; 

###  **2.1. Compartments**

The diagram below identifies the compartments in the scope of this operation.

            }
        }
    }
```

**Note**: For each policy select your desired compartment_ocid

This automation fully supports any type of OCI IAM Policy to be specified in the json format. 
For an example of such configuration and for extended documentation please refer to the [Identity & Access Management CIS Terraform module policies examples](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/terraform-oci-cis-landing-zone-iam/tree/main/policies/examples).


&nbsp; 

## **3. Setup Network Configuration**


For configuring and running the Open LZ EBS extension Network layer use the following JSON file: [ebs_network_rt_sl_v1.auto.tfvars.json](ebs_network_rt_sl_v1.auto.tfvars.json)

This configuration file will require changes to the resources to reference the OCIDs of the CIS Landing Zone which were deployed in OP01.
Search for the values indicated below and replace with the correct OCIDs:

| Resource         | OCID Text to Replace | Description |
|------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| VCN | \<OCID-VCN-HUB> | The OCID of the Hub VCN deployed by CIS: "dmz-vcn"
| Network Compartment | \<OCID-COMPARTMENT-NETWORK> | The OCID of the CIS Network Compartment: "network-cmp"
| Service Gateway | \<OCID-SERVICE-GATEWAY-HUB> | The OCID of the Hub Service Gateway deployed by CIS 
| Internet Gateway | \<OCID-INTERNET-GATEWAY-HUB> | The OCID of the Hub Internet Gateway deployed by CIS 
| Dynamic Routing Gateway | \<OCID-DYNAMIC-ROUTING-GATEWAY> | The OCID of the DRG deployed by CIS 
| DRG Route Table | \<OCID-DRG-ROUTE_TABLE> | The OCID of the DRG VCN Route Table deployed by CIS: "Autogenerated Drg Route Table for VCN attachments"

In addition, the following text must have the **xxx** contained within to be replaced with the appropriate Region Key, a list of region keys can be found [Here](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/regions.htm).

| Text to Replace | Example Replacement | Description |
|-----------------|---------------------|-------------|
| all-**xxx**-services-in-oracle-services-network | all-**fra**-services-in-oracle-services-network | This shows the correct replacement text for the Frankfurt region |

&nbsp; 

This configuration covers the following networking diagram. 

&nbsp; 

![Network Diagram](./diagrams/Network.png)

For complete documentation and a larger set of examples on configuring an OCI networking topology using this json terraform automation approach please refer to the [OCI CIS Terraform Networking Module](https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/terraform-oci-cis-landing-zone-networking) documentation and examples.

The network layer covers the next resources:

###  **3.1. Spoke VCNs**

OCI defines network resources in a hierarchy. This means that subnets, route tables, security lists, or gateways will depend on a specific VCN.
We will create three Spokes VCNs (VCN.02,VCN.03,VCN.04)

Example of a VCN creation:

```
"vcns": {
    "VCN-EBS-MGT-KEY": {
        "compartment_id": "<OCID-COMPARTMENT-NETWORK>",
        "block_nat_traffic": true,
        "cidr_blocks": [
            "10.0.1.0/24"
        ],
        "display_name": "ebs-mgt-vcn",
        "dns_label": "ebsmgtvcn",
        "is_attach_drg": true,
        "is_create_igw": false,
        "is_ipv6enabled": false,
        "is_oracle_gua_allocation_enabled": false,
        "route_tables": {},
        "security_lists": {},
        "subnets": {},
        "vcn_specific_gateways": {},
}
```
**Note**: 
* Change compartment_ocid with the ocid of the network compartment. **network-cmp ( CMP-02 )**


###  **4.2. Subnets**

We will create a three-layer configuration, adding three subnets per vcn.

Example of a Subnet creation:

```
"subnets": {
    "SN-MGT-WEB-KEY": {
        "compartment_id": "<OCID-COMPARTMENT-NETWORK>",
        "availability_domain": null,
        "cidr_block": "10.0.1.0/26",
        "dhcp_options_key": "default_dhcp_options",
        "display_name": "ebs-mgt-web-subnet",
        "dns_label": "ebsmgtwebsn",
        "prohibit_internet_ingress": true,
        "prohibit_public_ip_on_vnic": true,
        "route_table_key": "RT-MGT-WEB-VCN-KEY",
        "security_list_keys": [
            "SL-MGT-WEB-VCN-KEY"
        ]
    },
```
**Note**: 
* Change compartment_ocid with the ocid of the network compartment. **network-cmp ( CMP-02 )**
* Add route_table_key and security_list_keys to assign the desired route tables and security list to each subnet.



###  **3.3. Gateways**

We will add a Service Gateway and a NAT Gateway per spoke VCN.

Example of a Service Gateway and NAT Gateway creation:

```
"vcn_specific_gateways": {
    "service_gateways": {
        "SG-EBS-MGT-KEY": {
            "compartment_id": "<OCID-COMPARTMENT-NETWORK>",
            "display_name": "ebs-mgt-sgw",
            "services": "objectstorage"
        }
    },
    "nat_gateways": {
        "NG-EBS-MGT-KEY": {
            "compartment_id": "<OCID-COMPARTMENT-NETWORK>",
            "display_name": "ebs-mgt-ngw"
        }
    }
}
```
**Note**: Change compartment_ocid with the ocid of the network compartment. **network-cmp ( CMP-02 )**


###  **3.4. Security Lists**

We will create one SL per subnet. (SL.5,SL.6,SL.7,SL.8,SL.9,SL.10,SL.11,SL.12,SL.13)

Example of a Security List creation:

```
"security_lists": {
    "SL-MGT-WEB-VCN-KEY": {
        "compartment_id": "<OCID-COMPARTMENT-NETWORK>",
        "display_name": "ebs-mgt-web-subnet-security-list",
        "defined_tags": null,
        "freeform_tags": null,
        "egress_rules": [
            {
                "description": "Any egress from ebs-mgt-web-subnet",
                "dst": "0.0.0.0/0",
                "dst_type": "CIDR_BLOCK",
                "protocol": "TCP",
                "stateless": false
            }
        ],
        "ingress_rules": [
            {
                "description": "SSL External access to ebsmgt UI via LBR",
                "dst_port_max": 443,
                "dst_port_min": 443,
                "protocol": "TCP",
                "src": "0.0.0.0/0",
                "src_type": "CIDR_BLOCK",
                "stateless": false
            }
        ]
    }
},
```
**Note**: Change compartment_ocid with the ocid of the network compartment. **network-cmp ( CMP-02 )**


###  **3.5. Route Tables**

We need to create Route tables in the spoke VCNs (RT.9, RT.10, RT.11, RT.12, RT.13, RT.14, RT.15, RT.16, RT.17):

Example of a Route table creation:

```
"route_tables": {
    "RT-MGT-WEB-VCN-KEY": {
        "compartment_id": "<OCID-COMPARTMENT-NETWORK>",
        "display_name": "ebs-mgt-web-subnet-rtable",
        "route_rules": {
            "sgw_route": {
                "network_entity_key": "SG-EBS-MGT-KEY",
                "description": "Route for sgw",
                "destination": "all-services",
                "destination_type": "SERVICE_CIDR_BLOCK"
            },
            "ngw_route": {
                "network_entity_key": "NG-EBS-MGT-KEY",
                "description": "Route to ngw for EBS object storage location",
                "destination": "134.70.0.0/16",
                "destination_type": "CIDR_BLOCK"
            },
            "drg_route_1": {
                "description": "ebs-mgt-vcn to ebs-nprod-vcn VCN",
                "destination": "10.0.4.0/22",
                "destination_type": "CIDR_BLOCK",
                "network_entity_id": "<OCID-DYNAMIC-ROUTING-GATEWAY>"
            },
            "drg_route_2": {
                "description": "ebs-mgt-vcn to ebs-prod-vcn VCN",
                "destination": "10.0.8.0/22",
                "destination_type": "CIDR_BLOCK",
                "network_entity_id": "<OCID-DYNAMIC-ROUTING-GATEWAY>"
            }
        }
    },
```
**Note**: 
* Change compartment_ocid with the ocid of the network compartment. **network-cmp ( CMP-02 )**
* Change network_entity_id in route rules to the corresponding service gateways ids or drg ids.


Also, we need to inject route tables in the Hub VCN (RT.5, RT.6, RT.7, RT.8): 

Example of a Route table injection:

```
"inject_into_existing_vcns": {
"VCN-HUB-KEY": {
"vcn_id": "<OCID-VCN-HUB>",
"route_tables": {
"RT-DMZ-MGMT-KEY": {
    "compartment_id": "<OCID-COMPARTMENT-NETWORK>",
    "display_name": "dmz1-mgmt-subnet-rtable",
    "defined_tags": null,
    "freeform_tags": null,
    "route_rules": {
        "sgw_route": {
            "network_entity_id": "<OCID-SERVICE-GATEWAY-HUB>",
            "description": "Route for sgw",
            "destination": "objectstorage",
            "destination_type": "SERVICE_CIDR_BLOCK"
        },
        "igw_route": {
            "description": "Traffic destined to 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR range goes to Internet Gateway.",
            "destination": "0.0.0.0/0",
            "destination_type": "CIDR_BLOCK",
            "network_entity_id": "<OCID-INTERNET-GATEWAY-HUB>"
        },
        "drg_route_1": {
            "description": "Traffic destined to ebs-mgt-vcn VCN goes to DRG.",
            "destination": "10.0.1.0/24",
            "destination_type": "CIDR_BLOCK",
            "network_entity_id": "<OCID-DYNAMIC-ROUTING-GATEWAY>"
        },
        "drg_route_2": {
            "description": "Traffic destined to ebs-nprod-vcn VCN goes to DRG.",
            "destination": "10.0.4.0/22",
            "destination_type": "CIDR_BLOCK",
            "network_entity_id": "<OCID-DYNAMIC-ROUTING-GATEWAY>"
        },
        "drg_route_3": {
            "description": "Traffic destined to ebs-prod-vcn VCN goes to DRG.",
            "destination": "10.0.8.0/22",
            "destination_type": "CIDR_BLOCK",
            "network_entity_id": "<OCID-DYNAMIC-ROUTING-GATEWAY>"
        }
    }
},
```

**Note**: 
* Change vcn_ocid with the ocid of the Hub VCN.
* Change compartment_ocid with the ocid of the network compartment. **network-cmp ( CMP-02 )**
* Change network_entity_id in route rules to the corresponding internet gateways, service gateways ids or drg ids.


###  **3.6. DRG Attachements**

We need to add new DRG attachments (DRGA.02, DRGA.03, DRGA.04) to the DRG ( DRG.01) created by the CIS LZ (OP#01)

Example of a DRG attachment creation:

```
"drgattach": {
    "non_vcn_specific_gateways": {
        "inject_into_existing_drgs": {
            "DRG-KEY": {
                "drg_id": "<OCID-DYNAMIC-ROUTING-GATEWAY>",
                "drg_attachments": {
                    "DRG-VCN-EBS-MGT-KEY": {
                        "defined_tags": null,
                        "display_name": "ebs-mgt-vcn-drg-attachment",
                        "freeform_tags": null,
                        "drg_route_table_id": "<OCID-DRG-ROUTE_TABLE>",
                        "drg_route_table_name": null,
                        "network_details": {
                            "attached_resource_id": null,
                            "attached_resource_key": "VCN-EBS-MGT-KEY",
                            "type": "VCN",
                            "route_table_id": null,
                            "route_table_name": null,
                            "vcn_route_type": null
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Note**: 
* Change drg_route_table_id with the ocid of the DRG VCN Route Table deployed by CIS: "Autogenerated Drg Route Table for VCN attachments"

## **4. Run with ORM**

| STEP |  ACTION |
|---|---| 
| **1** | [![Deploy_To_OCI](../../../images/DeployToOCI.svg)](https://cloud.oracle.com/resourcemanager/stacks/create?zipUrl=https://github.com/oracle-quickstart/terraform-oci-open-lz/archive/refs/heads/master.zip&zipUrlVariables={"input_config_files_urls":","}) |
| **2** | Accept terms,  wait for the configuration to load. |
| **3** | Set the working directory to “orm-facade”. | 
| **4** | Set the stack name you prefer. | 
| **5** | Set the terraform version to 1.2.x. Click Next. | 
| **6** | Update with the links to your IAM and Network configurations. Click Next. |
| **7** | Un-check run apply. Click Create. 

&nbsp; 


## **5. Run with Terraform CLI**
&nbsp; 

### **5.1 Setup Terraform Authentication**

For authenticating against the OCI tenancy terraform execute the following [instructions](common_terraform_authentication.md).


&nbsp; 

### **5.2 Clone this Git repo to your Machine**

```
git clone git@github.com:oracle-quickstart/terraform-oci-open-lz.git
```

For referring to a specific module version, append *ref=\<version\>* to the *source* attribute value. Example: git clone git@github.com:oracle-quickstart/terraform-oci-open-lz.git?ref=v1.0.0

&nbsp; 

###  **5.3 Change the Directory to the Terraform Orchestrator Module**

 Change the directory to the [```terraform-oci-open-lz/orchestrator```](../../../../orchestrator/) terraform orchestrator module.

&nbsp; 

 ### **5.4 Run ```terraform init```**

Run terraform init to download all the required external terraform providers and terraform modules. See [command example](./tf_init_output_example.out) for more details on the expected output.

&nbsp; 

 ### **5.5 Run ```terraform plan```**

Run terraform plan with the IAM and Network configuration.

```
terraform plan \
-var-file ../examples/oci-lz-ext-ebs/json/oci-credentials.tfvars.json \
-var-file ../examples/oci-lz-ext-ebs/json/ebs_identity_cmp_grp_pl_v1.auto.tfvars.json \
-var-file ../examples/oci-lz-ext-ebs/json/ebs_network_rt_sl_v1.auto.tfvars.json \
-state ../examples/oci-lz-ext-ebs/terraform.tfstate
```

After the execution please analyze the output of the command above and check if it corresponds to your desired configuration.

Note that the ```terraform.tfstate``` file is generated in the configuration location and not in the terraform code location. This is the expected configuration as the terraform automation can support any number of configurations and the **state file** will belong to the configuration and not to the code.
  
The ideal scenario regarding the **state file** will be for each configuration to have a corresponding OCI Object Storage location for the state file. For more details on the Terraform state file recommended configuration please refer to the following [documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/terraformUsingObjectStore.htm).

&nbsp; 

### **5.6 Run ```terraform apply```**

Run terraform plan with the IAM and Network configuration. After  its execution the configured resources will be provisioned or updated on OCI.

```
terraform apply \
-var-file ../examples/oci-lz-ext-ebs/json/oci-credentials.tfvars.json \
-var-file ../examples/oci-lz-ext-ebs/json/ebs_identity_cmp_grp_pl_v1.auto.tfvars.json \
-var-file ../examples/oci-lz-ext-ebs/json/ebs_network_rt_sl_v1.auto.tfvars.json \
-state ../examples/oci-lz-ext-ebs/terraform.tfstate

```

Depending on your json configuration configurations the output of the ```terraform apply``` should be identical or similar to this [example](./tf_apply_output_example.out).

## **6. Known Issues**

### **6.1 ```Policy error```**

```
400-InvalidParameter, Compartment {ebs-cmp:ebs-nprod-cmp} does not exist or is not part of the policy compartment subtree
│ Suggestion: Please update the parameter(s) in the Terraform config as per error message Compartment {ebs-cmp:ebs-nprod-cmp} does not exist or is not part of the policy compartment subtree
