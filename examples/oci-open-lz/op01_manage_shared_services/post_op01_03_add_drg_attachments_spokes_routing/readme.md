## **2. Network Configuration Changes**

After the on-boarding of the new OE, different OE spoke VCNs will be created. To be able to communicate the different spokes between them and also with the hub, it is needed to attach the VCNs to the central DRG, managed by the Central Operations Team. It is also required to update the different hub VCN route tables to add the spoke VCNs destinations and force the network traffic to go through the North-South or East-West NFWs. We also have to consider the DRG route tables (not confuse with the VCN Route tables), that will tell the different network packets where to go when they reach a DRG.

We can see the different changes in our example in the following diagram:

### **2.1. DRG Attachments and Routing**

For the creation of the DRG Attachments and routing, we've to update the configuration in the following way:

                    }
                }
            }
        }
    },
}
```

As you can see, we're updating the attachment section, where initially we used to have just the Hub VCN attachment (*"DRGATT-FRA-HUB-VCN-KEY"*), with the attachments for the OE01 VCNs for DEV, NP and P environments as *"DRGATT-FRA-HUB-VCN-FRA-OE01-DEV-KEY"*, *"DRGATT-FRA-HUB-VCN-FRA-OE01-NP-KEY"* and *"DRGATT-FRA-HUB-VCN-FRA-OE01-P-KEY"* keys. We've to replace the "attached_resource_id" with the corresponding value of the spoke VCN OCID. The OP.02 operation is run by the Central Operations Team, so the VCN OCID of the new spokes is an information available to this team. Thus, they can control what VCNs they attach to the hub and which don't. No other teams (OE/Project), must have IAM policies permissions to be able to create attachments for security reasons.

**Notice** that in the Hub DRG Attachment (*"DRGATT-FRA-HUB-VCN-KEY"*), we're also configuring a route table for the VCN attachment, indicating that the VCN Route table "RT-00-HUB-VCN-INGRESS-KEY" will be used. As we'll see later in the VCNs Routing section, this route table is used to route the ingress traffic to the Hub VCN.

Another important information to define in the attachments is the DRG route tables to use. As you can see we have a couple of DRG Route Tables (in blue in the diagram):

* **Hub DRG Route Table**, called *"DRG-RT-FRA-HUB-KEY"*. This DRG Route table is a dynamic one, meaning that we don't have to define the needed routes to reach the spokes, as we would get them dynamically from their CIDR blocks. However, we've to define the import route distribution (*"IMPORT-HUB-RTD-KEY"*) with the criteria to gather these routes specifying that it is a DRG attachment of type VCN. 
  
* **Spokes DRG Route Table**, called *"DRG-RT-FRA-SPOKES-KEY"*. This DRG, in contrast with the Hub, has just an static route meaning that whenever we reach the DRG, for any destination (0.0.0.0/0), the next hop will be the Hub DRG attachment, eventually sending the traffic North-South or East-West firewalls to control and/or inspect the traffic.

### **2.2. VCNs Routing**

For the Hub VCN Routing, we've to modify the existing route tables to include the destinations to the different spokes. The affected VCN route tables are shown in the diagram in red.

The changes in the VCN route tables configuration are:

As you can see, we're updating the different route tables to add routing rules to be able to reach the spokes' CIDR Blocks. It'd depend on the route to force the traffic to go through the North-South or the East-West traffic. Remember that we'll use the North-South traffic for any incoming/outgoing traffic to OCI, meaning access from the Internet, on-prem/CSPs or through a NAT GW. 

In this way, let's revidw more information about each of the route tables:

* **Hub VCN Ingress traffic**, called *RT-00-HUB-VCN-INGRESS-KEY*. This route table is used by the Hub DRG Attachment to route the ingress traffic. Basically says:
  *  Any packet going to the Hub VCN LB subnet must go through the NS FW.
  
  *  Any packet going to the OE01 spokes' CIDR blocks (172.168.0.0/23, 172.168.2.0/23, 172.168.4.0/23 and 172.168.6.0/23), must go through the EW FW.
  
  *  Any packet going to the internet, must go through the NS FW.
  
* **Hub VCN LB subnet**, called *RT-01-HUB-VCN-LB-KEY*. This route table is used by the Load Balancer subnet. Basically says:
  * Any packet going to the to the OE01 spokes' CIDR blocks (172.168.2.0/23, 172.168.4.0/23 and 172.168.6.0/23), must go through the NS FW.
  
  * Any packet going to the internet, must go through the Internet Gateway.

* **Hub VCN NS subnet**, called *RT-02-HUB-VCN-NFWNS-KEY*. This route table is used by the North-South FW subnet. Basically says:
  * Any packet going to the to the OE01 spokes' CIDR blocks (172.168.0.0/23, 172.168.2.0/23, 172.168.4.0/23 and 172.168.6.0/23), must go through the DRG.
  
  * Any packet going to the internet, must go through the NAT Gateway.

* **Hub VCN EW subnet**, called *RT-03-HUB-VCN-NFWEW-KEY*. This route table is used by the East-West FW subnet. Basically says:
  * Any packet going to the to the OE01 spokes' CIDR blocks (172.168.0.0/23, 172.168.2.0/23, 172.168.4.0/23 and 172.168.6.0/23), must go through the DRG.

* **Hub VCN NAT GW**, called *RT-04-HUB-VCN-NATGW-KEY*. This route table is used by the NAT Gateway. Basically says:
  * Any packet going to the to the OE01 spokes' CIDR blocks (172.168.0.0/23, 172.168.2.0/23, 172.168.4.0/23 and 172.168.6.0/23), must go through the NAT Gateway.

**NOTICE:** We've to update the route rules going to the EW FW with the corresponding FW Private IP OCID, replacing the "*EW PRIVATE IP OCID*", with the Private IP that we can get from the OP.01 state file or the apply output of the first OP.01 operation.

After updating your network configuration, remember to run the plan/apply to update your OP.01 operation configuration.
