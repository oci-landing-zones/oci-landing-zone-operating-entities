# **[OCI FinOps Solution](#)**
## **An OCI Open LZ [Addon](#) that enables cost governance, visibility, and optimization through the FinOps solution**
&nbsp;

## **Overview**

The **OCI FinOps Solution** is an addon to the OCI Open Landing Zone framework. It enhances cost governance and financial visibility for Operating Entities by integrating **OCI FOCUS reports** directly with an **Autonomous Database and a dashboard** for insightful cost analysis.

The solution describes the workflow end‚Äëto‚Äëend: it securely fetches FOCUS reports from the central tenancy into ADB and visualizes them in a user‚Äëfriendly interface. All components reside in a private network within OCI.

> **Why another dashboard?**  
> While OCI provides native Cost Analysis, this addon supports scenarios such as **multi‚Äëcloud cost aggregation**, **external stakeholder access**, and **custom reporting** for FinOps teams.

> **What is FinOps?**  
> FinOps is an operational model and cultural practice that maximizes cloud value through data‚Äëdriven decisions and financial accountability across engineering, finance, and business teams.

### OCI FinOps Addon Architecture

### OCI FinOps Addon Resources

| **Resource** | **Description** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Autonomous Database (ADB)** | Central data store for the FinOps platform. Provisioned with a **private endpoint** inside the VCN, it directly ingests FOCUS reports from the central tenancy and powers the visualization layer. |
| **UI Dashboard** | Presents FinOps insights on top of ADB. You can build the UI with **Oracle APEX**, **Oracle Analytics Cloud**, or another BI tool of choice. |
| **VCN & Subnets** | A dedicated **Virtual Cloud Network** with private subnets to host ADB, the dashboard, and related components in an isolated, secure manner‚Äîkeeping traffic off the public internet. |
| **IAM Policies** | Includes user policies to manage the FinOps platform and **service policies** that grant ADB permission to fetch FOCUS reports from the central tenancy, all in a controlled and auditable way. |

### OCI FinOps Addon Deployment Guide

To get started with the OCI FinOps addon, ensure that a Landing Zone (LZ) is already deployed in your OCI tenancy. This guide is designed to build on top of the [**One-OE Landing Zone**](https://github.com/oci-landing-zones/oci-landing-zone-operating-entities/tree/master/blueprints/one-oe/runtime/one-stack), using the **Hub Model E** network topology.

You can also use other supported OCI Landing Zones as your foundation, such as [CIS landing zone](https://github.com/oci-landing-zones/oci-cis-landingzone-quickstart), [OCI Core Landing Zone](https://github.com/oci-landing-zones/terraform-oci-core-landingzone) or [Multi-OE](https://github.com/oci-landing-zones/oci-landing-zone-operating-entities/tree/master/blueprints/multi-oe/generic_v1/runtime).

Once your base Landing Zone is in place:

- üìÅ **Review/Modify and apply** the IAM and Networking configurations provided in the [`finops-setup`](finops-setup) folder.
- üõ†Ô∏è **Follow the step-by-step instructions** in the [`finops-setup`](finops-setup) guide to deploy the FinOps solution with Autonomous Database and configure the ingestion and dashboard components.


&nbsp;

### Summary

This addon enhances the [OCI One-OE Landing Zone](https://github.com/oci-landing-zones/oci-landing-zone-operating-entities/tree/master/blueprints/one-oe/runtime/one-stack) by embedding a FinOps platform that delivers cost governance, visibility, and optimization. It automates the ingestion and analysis of OCI FOCUS reports using an Autonomous Database (private endpoint) and a flexible dashboard layer‚Äîno Object Storage or Functions required. The solution offers deep insights without necessitating OCI console access and supports centralized cost analysis across multiple clouds.
