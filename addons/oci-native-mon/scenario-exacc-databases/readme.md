# **[EXACC](#)**
## **An OCI Open LZ Addon to enable Database management & Operation Insights and Logging Analytics for EXACC**


## Design

The ExaCC network operates within the customer's data center, when ExaCC is installed on-premises, it connects to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) via a secure, dedicated management network. This connection to the OCI control plane enables Oracle to:

* Provision and manage ExaCC resources remotely.
* Monitor system health and usage.
* Apply updates and patches.

To enable Observability native services, we will need an additional connection from on-premises to a VCN with a Service Gateway. This can be achieved through either FastConnect or IPSec VPN. In our case, we will use our [HUB E Model](https://github.com/oci-landing-zones/oci-landing-zone-operating-entities/tree/master/addons/oci-hub-models/hub_e) for this purpose.

This asset primarily focuses on enabling Native Observability services within the Landing Zone. However, when addressing EXACC workloads, it is also essential to consider events and alarms. These aspects are covered in our EXACC Landing Zone extension, which can be found [here](https://github.com/oci-landing-zones/oci-landing-zone-operating-entities/tree/master/workload-extensions/exacc).

The extension also provides an OCI Event Rule to capture the events generated by the Operator Access Control activities and are integrated with the OCI Notification Topic used by the Global Security Team.

Enabled Observability Resources:
* Shared ExaDB-C@C Platform Events,Alarms and Announcements
* Production Workload Environment ExaDB-C@C Platform Events,Events, Alarms and Announcements
* Pre-Production Workload Environment ExaDB-C@C Platform Events,Events, Alarms and Announcements
* Example Production Project Alarms.
* Example Pre-Production Project Alarms.
