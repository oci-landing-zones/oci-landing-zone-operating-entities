# **[EXACC](#)**
## **An OCI Open LZ Addon to enable Database management & Operation Insights and Logging Analytics for EXACC**


## Design

The ExaCC network operates within the customer's data center, when ExaCC is installed on-premises, it connects to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) via a secure, dedicated management network. This connection to the OCI control plane enables Oracle to:

* Provision and manage ExaCC resources remotely.
* Monitor system health and usage.
* Apply updates and patches.

To enable Observability native services, we will need an additional connection from on-premises to a VCN with a Service Gateway. This can be achieved through either FastConnect or IPSec VPN. In our case, we will use our [HUB E Model](https://github.com/oci-landing-zones/oci-landing-zone-operating-entities/tree/master/addons/oci-hub-models/hub_e) for this purpose.

This asset primarily focuses on enabling native observability services within the Landing Zone to support proactive monitoring goals. However, when addressing EXACC workloads, it is also essential to incorporate events and alarms for reactive monitoring purposes.

These aspects are covered in our EXACC Landing Zone extension, which can be found [here](https://github.com/oci-landing-zones/oci-landing-zone-operating-entities/tree/master/workload-extensions/exacc).

The extension also provides an OCI Event Rule to capture the events generated by the Operator Access Control activities and are integrated with the OCI Notification Topic used by the Global Security Team.

Enabled Observability Resources:
* Shared ExaDB-C@C Platform Events,Alarms and Announcements
* Production Workload Environment ExaDB-C@C Platform Events,Events, Alarms and Announcements
* Pre-Production Workload Environment ExaDB-C@C Platform Events,Events, Alarms and Announcements
* Example Production Project Alarms.
* Example Pre-Production Project Alarms.



## Implementation

Follow these steps to enable monitoring and observability for your EXACC environment through our Landing Zone assets:


**Step 1**. 

An existing deployment of the OCI Landing Zone is required. In this guide, we will build on top of the One-OE blueprint foundation. For the Hub-and-Spoke model, we will use the simplest configuration, Hub E. Additionally, we'll need to set up FastConnect or an IPSec VPN between the customer's CPE (Customer Premises Equipment) and the DRG.

**Step 2**. 
 
To simplify the onboarding of your Exadata Cloud@Customer (ExaCC) environment into a secure, best-practice cloud framework, we will extend the Landing Zone using the ExaCC Landing Zone Extension. You can follow next [steps](https://github.com/oci-landing-zones/oci-landing-zone-operating-entities/tree/master/workload-extensions/exacc).

**Step 3**. 

To enable Observability native services for EXACC, use the EXACC JSONs files provided in this asset. 

Our add-on template includes all the necessary components, such as cmps, groups, a dedicated monitoring Vault, policies to enable Database Management and Ops Insights.

Now, the landing zone is ready to proceed with the necessary steps to enable the observability services.

* To enable Database Management follow this [steps](https://github.com/oracle-devrel/technology-engineering/blob/O%26M-for-LZ/manageability-and-operations/observability-and-manageability/database-management/LZ-addons/steps_to_enable_DBM_ExaCC.md)
* To enable Ops Insights follow this [steps](https://github.com/oracle-devrel/technology-engineering/blob/O%26M-for-LZ/manageability-and-operations/observability-and-manageability/operations-insights/LZ-addons/steps_to_enable_OPSI_ExaCC.md)
* To enable Logging Analytics follow this steps TBD
