# **[EXACC](#)**
## **An OCI Open LZ Addon to enable Database management & Operation Insights and Logging Analytics **

For EXACC, we only have the option of a global approach. We deployed the DM/OPSI PEs in the HUB VCN, reusing the monitoring subnet (MON) that is included in all our LZ HUB models.

> [!NOTE]  
> This asset primarily focuses on enabling Native Observability services within the Landing Zone. However, when addressing EXACC workloads, it is also essential to consider events and alarms. These aspects are covered in our EXACC Landing Zone extension, which can be found [here](https://github.com/oci-landing-zones/oci-landing-zone-operating-entities/tree/master/workload-extensions/exacc).
