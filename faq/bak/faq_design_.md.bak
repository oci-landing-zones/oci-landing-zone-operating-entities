# FAQ

## Assets: Blueprints, add-ons and workload extensions.

A1. **Which LZ blueprint size should I choose?**

   * Size S-M ( [one-oe](https://github.com/oci-landing-zones/oci-landing-zone-operating-entities/tree/master/blueprints/one-oe) ): Choose this for a single Operating Entity with its environments, platforms, and projects within one OCI tenancy. Ideal for single business units or smaller organizations.
     
   * Size L ([ multi-oe](https://github.com/oci-landing-zones/oci-landing-zone-operating-entities/tree/master/blueprints/multi-oe) ): Select this when you have multiple Operating Entities sharing common services while maintaining OE-dedicated resources in a single tenancy. Best for organizations with multiple business units requiring some level of isolation.

   * Size XL ([ multi-tenancy](https://github.com/oci-landing-zones/oci-landing-zone-operating-entities/tree/master/blueprints/multi-tenancy) ): Use this for enterprise-scale deployments spanning multiple OCI tenancies. Suitable for large organizations requiring complete isolation between Operating Entities.

A2. **Can I migrate from one blueprint model to another?**

  Yes, migration between blueprints is possible. All blueprints are built on the same CIS best practices,share a common structure, and use the same modular building blocks, which facilitates transitions between them.

  However, migration still requires careful planning and execution. Depending on the complexity and the direction of migration (one-oe to multi-oe, one-oe to multi-tenancy, multi-oe to multi-tenancy...), you may need to:

  * Restructure compartment hierarchies
  * Reconfigure network topologies
  * Adjust IAM policies and governance controls
  * Migrate resources between compartments or tenancies

  For these reasons, it's recommended to choose the appropriate model from the start based on your organization's current and projected needs. Consider factors like governance requirements, isolation needs, growth projections, and whether you anticipate adding new Operating Entities in the near future.

A3. **What LZ blueprint fits better for 3 layer apps?**

one-oe template cover one entity with two different envs (Prod and PreProd).
In each enviroment will allow isolation between web, app, databases layers.


A4. **Which HUB models are included in the Operating Entities LZ blueprints?**


A5. **What's the difference between blueprints, add-ons, and workload extensions?**

   * **Blueprints**: Core landing zone architectures (one-oe,multi-oe,multi-tenancy) providing the foundational OCI structure.
   * **Add-ons**: Complementary components like network hubs models, subnetting, DNS, TBAC, etc  that enhance the base blueprint.
   * **Workload Extensions**: Specific application workloads (EBS, OCVS, AI services) that can be deployed on top of the landing zone.

A6. **Can I customize the blueprints for my specific requirements?**
    Yes! The blueprints are designed to be customizable. You can modify the declarative configuration files to adjust compartment structures, network topologies, security policies, and other elements to match your organization's specific needs.
