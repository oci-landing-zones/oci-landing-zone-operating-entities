## Support and Contribution

S1. **How do I get support?**
  
  For issues, questions, or feature requests, please open an issue in this GitHub repository.  

  > [!NOTE]
  Please do NOT raise a GitHub Issue to report a security vulnerability. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please submit a report to secalert_us@oracle.com preferably with a proof of concept. Please review some additional information on how to report security vulnerabilities to Oracle. We encourage people who contact Oracle Security to use email encryption using our encryption key.
