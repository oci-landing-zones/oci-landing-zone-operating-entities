## Support & Contribution Questions

### S1. Is this an official Oracle product?

The OCI Open LZ (Operating Entities Landing Zone) is an open-source project distributed under the Universal Permissive License (UPL), Version 1.0.

While it is created and maintained by Oracle through the oci-landing-zones GitHub organization and incorporates Oracle best practices, it is not an official Oracle product with traditional support. It is an Oracle-driven initiative that provides blueprints and assets to simplify OCI onboarding for organizations.

The OCI Open LZ is built on top of the official OCI Landing Zone modules (IAM, networking, security, observability, and governance), which are officially supported OCI resource modules. For more details, see question G4.
